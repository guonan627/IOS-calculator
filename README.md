for a better presenting, I did not create new branch under the calculator repository.

AC is all-clear and reset the screen back to 0;
+/- is negative button, % is percentage but currently could only calculate the value divided by 100.

update on 2021/07/14:
  It seems like I fixed all bugs.
  new features:
  1) calculator now supports quick calculating function.
      eg. 3 + 3, if you click another + - x รท, display area will automatically calculate the result after you click the second operator.
  2) calculator now could automatically help you clean previous result.
      eg. if you calculated 3 + 3 and the result display is 9. If you want to start another calculation, just easily click any number and the result display will show the new process without clicking AC.

This is how the calculator looks like, all styles from iPhone calculator by ios 12.4.
